# ember-did-change-attrs

This addon is a WIP rethink of [ember-diff-attrs](https://github.com/workmanw/ember-diff-attrs) which offered a decorator style approach to this problem.

With `ember-did-change-attrs` we're going to solve the same problem using mixins instead of decorators. The hope is to offer a cleaner and more clear syntax without sacrificing functionality.
